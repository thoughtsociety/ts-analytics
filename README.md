A fork of 
https://github.com/ericcgu/Flask_Dash_Container

Added extra items to requirements.txt in order to get this to correctly build and run.
Demos a sample StockTicker app (renamed app.py) which originated 
on [Jose Portilla's Dash course in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/interactive-python-dashboards-with-plotly-and-dash/learn/v4/overview).

## Synopsis

A Nginx and Python Flask Container used for bootstraping continuous deployment of Dash / Plot.ly Applications.

## What is Dash? mmmm

Dash Web Applications combine the full power and best features of Plot.ly, Python, React.js and Flask.
